ISSUE: Keep getting 204 when requesting the currently playing track.
    Solution: I found solution. In my case I only started to play any song in my Windows desktop app. This makes my Windows app active and current device.

NOTE!!
    error: {status: 403, message: "Player command failed: Premium required", reason: "PREMIUM_REQUIRED"}
